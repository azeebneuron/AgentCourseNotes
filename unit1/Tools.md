**What are AI Tools?**

*   Functions given to LLMs to extend their capabilities. They achieve a clear objective.

**Common AI Tools:**

*   **Web Search:** Access up-to-date internet information.
*   **Image Generation:** Create images from text.
*   **Retrieval:** Access information from external sources.
*   **API Interface:** Interact with external services (GitHub, YouTube, etc.).
*   These are just examples; you can create tools for almost any use case.

**Why are Tools Important?**

*   **Complement LLM Capabilities:** Provide functionality the LLM lacks (e.g., a calculator for arithmetic).
*   **Access Real-Time Data:** LLMs are trained on past data; tools provide current information (e.g., weather).

**Structure of a Tool:**

*   Textual description of the tool's purpose.
*   Callable (the function to perform the action).
*   Arguments (inputs) with type annotations.
*   (Optional) Outputs with type annotations.

**How Tools Work:**

1.  **LLM Knows About Tools:** The System Prompt contains details about what tools are available, their purpose, and how to use them.
2.  **LLM Recognizes Need:** The LLM analyzes a user's request and determines if a tool is needed.
3.  **LLM Invokes Tool:** The LLM generates text (often in code-like format) to call the tool with specific arguments.
4.  **Agent Intervenes:** The Agent (the surrounding system) parses the LLM output, identifies the tool call, and executes the tool.
5.  **Tool Result Returns:** The tool performs its task and provides output back to the Agent.
6.  **Agent Updates LLM:** The Agent adds the tool's output as a new message to the conversation and sends the updated conversation back to the LLM.
7.  **LLM Composes Response:** The LLM uses the tool's output to generate a final response for the user.
8.  **Important**: Tool calls are hidden from the user, creating the impression the LLM executed the tool directly.

**How to Give Tools to an LLM:**

*   **System Prompt Description:** The most common method is to include detailed textual descriptions of tools in the system prompt.  This requires precision in describing what the tool does and its expected inputs.  Structured formats like JSON or specific computer languages are often used for clarity.

**Auto-Formatting Tool Descriptions (using Python example):**

*   **Leverage Code:** Use Python's introspection to extract tool information (name, description, inputs, outputs) directly from the code. This requires good coding practices (type hints, docstrings, function names).
*   **Tool Class:** Create a generic `Tool` class to represent a tool with its properties and behavior.
*   **Decorator:** Use a Python decorator (`@tool`) to automatically create the `Tool` object from a function definition.

**Benefits of Auto-Formatting:**

*   **Concise and Precise:** Uses code's inherent clarity.
*   **Automated:** Reduces manual effort and potential errors.
*   **Consistent:** Ensures all tools are described in a uniform way.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   Tools give LLMs expanded functionality.
*   They overcome limitations of training data.
*   LLMs don't directly "call" tools; the Agent does it based on the LLM's output.
*   Good tool descriptions in the system prompt are essential.
*   Automating tool description generation is highly beneficial.
