**Thought: Internal Reasoning**

*   **Definition:** The Agent's internal reasoning and planning process for solving tasks.
*   **How it Works:**
    *   The Agent leverages its LLM to analyze information presented in the prompt.
    *   It's like an internal dialogue where the Agent strategizes its approach.
    *   The Agent uses current observations to decide the next action(s).
    *   It breaks down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
    *   It reflects on past experiences.
    *   It adjusts its plans based on new information.
*   **Examples of Common Thoughts:**
    *   Planning: "I need to break this task into three steps..."
    *   Analysis: "Based on the error message..."
    *   Decision Making: "Given the user's budget..."
    *   Problem Solving: "To optimize this code..."
    *   Memory Integration: "The user mentioned their preference..."
    *   Self-Reflection: "My last approach didn't work..."
    *   Goal Setting: "To complete this task..."
    *   Prioritization: "The security vulnerability..."
*   **Note:** Thought process is optional for LLMs fine-tuned for function-calling.

**The ReAct Approach**

*   **What is it?** A prompting technique: "Reasoning" (Think) + "Acting" (Act).
*   **How it Works:** Appends "Let's think step by step" before the LLM generates the next tokens.

*   **Why it's Effective:**
    *   Encourages the LLM to generate a plan by decomposing the problem into sub-tasks, not just directly generating the final solution.
    *   This leads to fewer errors because sub-steps are considered in more detail.
*   **Advanced Training:**
    *   Models like Deepseek R1 and OpenAI's o1 are fine-tuned to "think before answering."
    *   Trained to include specific thinking sections (e.g., enclosed between `<think>` and `</think>` special tokens). This is not just prompting, but a training technique.
