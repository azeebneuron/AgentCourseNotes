## What is an Agent?
An **Agent** is an AI model that can **reason, plan, and interact** with its environment to achieve a user-defined objective.

- **Brain (AI Model):** Handles reasoning and planning.
- **Body (Capabilities & Tools):** Executes actions using tools.

Example: ChatGPT can generate images because it has access to an **image-generation tool**.

### How Agents Work
1. **Receive input** (e.g., user query)
2. **Decide action** (via reasoning & planning)
3. **Execute via tools** (e.g., web search, email sender)

### Real-world Applications
- **Virtual Assistants:** Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant
- **Customer Service Chatbots:** Automate support & transactions
- **AI NPCs in Games:** Enhance character interactivity
