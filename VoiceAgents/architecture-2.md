This lesson shifts focus from the client-to-server communication (covered in Part 1) to what happens on the **server side**. It explains how the AI processes incoming audio, decides when to respond, and handles interruptions.

### End-to-End Architecture - Part 2

#### 1. The Server-Side Pipeline: From Voice to Response

The server processes the user's voice in a real-time pipeline, a series of steps that happen concurrently.

* **Step 1: Speech-to-Text (STT)**
    * The user's voice audio is streamed to an STT model.
    * This model transcribes the speech into text in real-time as the user is speaking.

* **Step 2: Turn Detection (The "When to Respond" Problem)**
    * This is the most complex part. The agent needs to know when the user has finished talking so it can start generating a response. Relying on silence alone is not enough, because people often pause naturally while thinking.
    * A sophisticated, two-part system is used:
        * **Voice Activity Detection (VAD):** A simple but fast model that detects human speech in the audio stream. When the VAD detects a pause (the absence of speech), it starts a timer.
        * **Semantic Turn Detector:** A more advanced model that analyzes the *content* (the meaning) of the transcribed text. It predicts whether the user's sentence or phrase is grammatically and conversationally complete.
    * **The Decision:** The agent combines these two signals. An "end-of-turn" event is triggered only when **both** the VAD has detected a sufficient pause **and** the semantic model believes the user has finished their thought.

#### 2. Generating and Delivering the Response

* **Step 3: Large Language Model (LLM)**
    * Once the end-of-turn is detected, the complete transcription is sent to the LLM.
    * Crucially, the **entire conversation history** (previous turns, function calls, results, etc.) is also sent along with the new transcription. This provides the LLM with the necessary context to generate a coherent and relevant response.

* **Step 4: Text-to-Speech (TTS)**
    * The LLM's text response is not generated all at once. It is *streamed* word-by-word to a TTS model.
    * The TTS model converts this incoming stream of text into audible speech and sends it back to the user, also in a stream. This reduces the perceived delay, as the user starts hearing the agent's response almost immediately.

#### 3. Handling Interruptions: The Key to Natural Conversation

Real conversations are not always orderly; people interrupt each other. A good voice agent must handle this gracefully.

* **How it works:** The **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)** system is always listening. If the user starts speaking *while the agent is responding*, the VAD detects this incoming speech as an interruption.
* **The Action:** An interruption signal is immediately sent through the entire pipeline.
    * It stops the LLM from generating any more text.
    * It stops the TTS from speaking.
    * The entire pipeline is flushed and reset, ready to process the user's new input.

This interruption mechanism is vital for making the conversation feel fluid and preventing the agent from talking over the user.
